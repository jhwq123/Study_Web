        The Little Mermaid lives with her father, a sea king, grandmother, and five older sisters. Mermaids have permission to rise out of the sea when they reach their fifteenth year.
        She came down to the sea and asked her grandma, "Can humans live forever?" 
        The old lady replied that mermaids sometimes lived up to three hundred years, but the span of human life was even shorter.
        The grandma also said that when a mermaid died, it became a sea bubble, while humans lived with immortal eternal.

        It was finally the youngest princess's turn. As she swam up the water, she saw a ship holding a banquet. It was a birthday party for a prince. The moment the Little Mermaid saw the prince, she fell in love.
        The Little Mermaid wanted to be a human. She wished she would love the prince forever as a human. She went to the sea witch and asked for her help.

        Then a storm suddenly struck, and the ship sank. The mermaid managed to rescue the prince on the verge of drowning. 
        She took the unconscious prince to the coast near a convent. The girl hid nearby and waited for someone to help him out.
        Instead of giving a potion for making human legs, the sorceress demanded the princess's tongue, which allowed her to sing beautiful songs.

        A young woman from the monastery found the prince and took care of him. 
        The prince, coming to life, mistook the woman for a lifesaver. The Little Mermaid was heartbroken with grief.
        The witch tempted that human legs could let the lovely girl dance more beautifully than any other woman. 
        Yet the evil magician also warned that dancing would claim pain and bleeding to her feet as if treading upon sharp knives.
